This version:  
- Uses professional language and consistent terminology.  
- Highlights features clearly with icons and bold headings.  
- Improves readability with bullet points, spacing, and clear sections.  
- Provides polished instructions for setup, screenshots, and deployment.  

If you want, I can also **add a visual ‚ÄúFeature Table‚Äù with icons** to make the README look like a professional SaaS product page, which is very appealing on GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that next?
